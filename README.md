### Tree-growth-in-the-tropics###

This repository consists of R functions to clean and analyse tree-growth data in the tropics.

1. The first set is aimed to detect abnormal growths and possible errors for their case-by-case revision and change. 
   (available at: GEMcarbon.R/datacleaning_dendrometers_2016.r )
2. The second set is meant to to analyse individual increases per tree and calculate the anomaly by subtracting the increase from the average of all months.
3. The third set is meant to adequate climate factors into monthly measurements
4. The fourth set is meant to relate the anomalies with monthly climate factors
